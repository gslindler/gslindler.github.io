<h2><b><font color="Slateblue">History of Atlanta</font></b></h2>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia can be traced back to 1837. It marked the end of the Western & Atlantic railroad line. The first name of the city was Marthasville (named after the governor at the time's daughter). It was then changed to Atlanta because it was the feminine name for the Atlantic railroad. It started out as a major transportation hub and still is that way. Hartsfiled-Jackson International Airport is the busy airport in the world to this day. Atlanta is the capital of the South and has been since the beginning of its foundation.</p>
